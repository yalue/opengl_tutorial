OpenGL Tutorial Code
====================

I'm just following the tutorial at [this website](https://learnopengl.com/).
I'm doing everything in pure C, though.

Features
--------

 - No C++

 - Loads rudimentary .obj files. (In Blender, make sure to triangulate faces,
   and only include one object per file.)
